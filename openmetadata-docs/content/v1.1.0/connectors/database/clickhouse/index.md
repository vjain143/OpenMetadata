If you don't want to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion container to configure the workflows via the UI, then you can check
the following docs to connect using Airflow SDK or with the CLI.

## Requirements


Clickhouse user must grant `SELECT` privilege on `system.*` and schema/tables to fetch the metadata of tables and views.

* Create a new user
* More details https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user

```sql
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY <password>
```

* Grant Permissions
* More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant

```sql
-- Grant SELECT and SHOW to that user
-- More details on permissions can be found here at https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant
GRANT SELECT, SHOW ON system.* to <username>;
GRANT SELECT ON <schema_name>.* to <username>;
```

### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler worflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/profiler) and data quality tests [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality).

### Usage & Lineage
For the usage and lineage workflow, the user will need `SELECT` privilege. You can find more information on the usage workflow [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/usage) and the lineage workflow [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/lineage).

To deploy OpenMetadata, check the Deployment guides.

To run the Ingestion via the UI you'll need to use the OpenMetadata Ingestion Container, which comes shipped with
custom Airflow plugins to handle the workflow deployment.

## Metadata Ingestion

{% stepsContainer %}

{% step srNumber=1 %}

{% stepDescription title="1. Visit the Services Page" %}

The first step is ingesting the metadata from your sources. Under
Settings, you will find a Services link an external source system to
OpenMetadata. Once a service is created, it can be used to configure
metadata, usage, and profiler workflows.

To visit the Services page, select Services from the Settings menu.

{% step srNumber=2 %}

{% stepDescription title="2. Create a New Service" %}

Click on the 'Add New Service' button to start the Service creation.

{% step srNumber=3 %}

{% stepDescription title="3. Select the Service Type" %}

{% /stepVisualInfo %}

{% /step %}

{% step srNumber=4 %}

{% stepDescription title="4. Name and Describe your Service" %}

Provide a name and description for your service as illustrated below.

#### Service Name

OpenMetadata uniquely identifies services by their Service Name. Provide
a name that distinguishes your deployment from other services, including
the other {connector} services that you might be ingesting metadata
from.

{% /stepVisualInfo %}

{% /step %}


{% step srNumber=5 %}

{% stepDescription title="5. Configure the Service Connection" %}

In this step, we will configure the connection settings required for
this connector. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that
you've configured the connector to read from your clickhouse service as
desired.

{% extraContent parentTagName="stepsContainer" %}

#### Connection Options

- **Username**: Specify the User to connect to Clickhouse. It should have enough privileges to read all the metadata.
- **Password**: Password to connect to Clickhouse.
- **Host and Port**: Enter the fully qualified hostname and port number for your Clickhouse deployment in the Host and Port field.
- **Connection Options (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection options that can be sent to Clickhouse during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs.
You can find the full list of accepted options [here](https://clickhouse-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#clickhouse_driver.connection.Connection)
- **Connection Arguments (Optional)**: Enter the details for any additional connection arguments such as security or protocol configs that can be sent to Clickhouse during the connection. These details must be added as Key-Value pairs. 
  - In case you are using Single-Sign-On (SSO) for authentication, add the `authenticator` details in the Connection Arguments as a Key-Value pair as follows: `"authenticator" : "sso_login_url"`

- **Connecting to Clickhouse with SSL Certificate**: You will need to use the `clickhouse+native` connection scheme. Then in the `Connection Options` reference the following key with their value:
  - `verify`: `true`
  - `secure`: `true`
  - `keyfile`: `/path/to/key/file` 

  The `keyfile` needs to be accessible by the service running the ingestion. For example if you are running the ingestion in a docker container, your `keyfile` needs to be present in the container at the location specify as a value in the `Connection Options`. Additionally, your `keyfile` needs to be in the `.cert` or `.pem` format.

Once the credentials have been added, click on `Test Connection` and Save
the changes.

- **Database Filter Pattern (Optional)**: Use to database filter patterns to control whether or not to include database as part of metadata ingestion.
  - **Include**: Explicitly include databases by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the Include field. OpenMetadata will include all databases with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other databases will be excluded.

  - **Include**: Explicitly include tables by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the Include field. OpenMetadata will include all tables with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other tables will be excluded.
  - **Exclude**: Explicitly exclude tables by adding a list of comma-separated regular expressions to the Exclude field. OpenMetadata will exclude all tables with names matching one or more of the supplied regular expressions. All other tables will be included.
- **Include views (toggle)**: Set the Include views toggle to control whether or not to include views as part of metadata ingestion.
- **Include tags (toggle)**: Set the 'Include Tags' toggle to control whether to include tags as part of metadata ingestion.
- **Enable Debug Log (toggle)**: Set the Enable Debug Log toggle to set the default log level to debug, these logs can be viewed later in Airflow.

- **Mark Deleted Tables (toggle)**: Set the Mark Deleted Tables toggle to flag tables as soft-deleted if they are not present anymore in the source system.
- **Mark Deleted Tables from Filter Only (toggle)**: Set the Mark Deleted Tables from Filter Only toggle to flag tables as soft-deleted if they are not present anymore within the filtered schema or database only. This flag is useful when you have more than one ingestion pipelines. For example if you have a schema

{% step srNumber=8 %}

{% stepDescription title="8. Schedule the Ingestion and Deploy" %}

Scheduling can be set up at an hourly, daily, weekly, or manual cadence. The
timezone is in UTC. Select a Start Date to schedule for ingestion. It is
optional to add an End Date.

Review your configuration settings. If they match what you intended,
click Deploy to create the service and schedule metadata ingestion.

If something doesn't look right, click the Back button to return to the
appropriate step and change the settings as needed.

After configuring the workflow, you can click on Deploy to create the
pipeline.

## Troubleshooting

 ### Workflow Deployment Error

If there were any errors during the workflow deployment process, the
Ingestion Pipeline Entity will still be created, but no workflow will be
present in the Ingestion container.

- You can then edit the Ingestion Pipeline and Deploy it again.

- From the Connection tab, you can also Edit the Service if needed.
